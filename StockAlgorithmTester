Here's the Gist for all the Physicists and non physicists: the name of the game is to learn how to 
continueously import large volumes of data then parse and manipulate the 
data. 

For this project we will start downloading stock data from the internet
and using that as a basis for our stock simulator. 

We will have a 'bank roll' which we will have as an initial investment.
the goal here is to try different stock trading algorythms in hopes to try
to maximize profits and minimize losses.
