Here is where we stalk stocks........like stalkers.........or stockers...?
Here's the Gist for the Physicists: the name of the game is to learn how to 
continueously import large volumes of data then parse and manipulate the 
data. 

For this project we will start downloading stock data from the internet
and using that as a basis for our stock simulator. 

We will have a 'bank roll' which we will have as an initial investment.
the goal here is to try different stock algorythms in hopes to get dirty
stinking filthy rich!!!
